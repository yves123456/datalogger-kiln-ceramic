This Arduino program collects temperature data from a pottery kiln using four thermocouples connected via MAX31856 amplifiers. It displays the collected temperatures on four separate LED displays. The program is designed to work with SPI communication for the thermocouples and handles fault detection and temperature reading for each sensor.
Description of the Code

Setup:

    Include Libraries:
        The program uses the Adafruit_MAX31856 library for the thermocouple amplifiers and the TM1637Display library for the LED displays.

    Initialize Thermocouples:
        Four Adafruit_MAX31856 objects are created for the thermocouples with specific SPI pins.
        The thermocouples are set to use type S thermocouples.
        Continuous conversion mode and noise filter settings are configured for each thermocouple.

    Initialize LED Displays:
        Four TM1637Display objects are created with specific pins for CLK and DIO connections.

Main Loop:

    Fault Checking:
        For each thermocouple, faults such as range errors, high/low junction faults, over/under voltage faults, and open circuit faults are checked and logged.

    Temperature Reading:
        If the conversion is complete and no faults are detected, the temperature is read from each thermocouple and stored in variables. The cold junction temperature is also read.

    Data Output:
        Every 50 iterations (approximately every 100 seconds), the collected temperatures and fault statuses are printed to the serial monitor for logging.

    Display Update:
        The temperatures are displayed on the LED displays with a brightness setting of 5.

    Loop Delay:
        The main loop runs every 2 seconds.

Wiring:

Thermocouples (MAX31856):

    Thermocouple 1: CS pin (13), SCK pin (12), DO pin (11), DI pin (10)
    Thermocouple 2: CS pin (5), SCK pin (4), DO pin (3), DI pin (2)
    Thermocouple 3: CS pin (16), SCK pin (17), DO pin (18), DI pin (19)
    Thermocouple 4: CS pin (42), SCK pin (44), DO pin (46), DI pin (48)

LED Displays (TM1637):

    Display 1: CLK pin (26), DIO pin (27)
    Display 2: CLK pin (28), DIO pin (29)
    Display 3: CLK pin (30), DIO pin (31)
    Display 4: CLK pin (32), DIO pin (33)

This description summarizes the main functionality and wiring of your Arduino program for monitoring the temperature of a pottery kiln using multiple thermocouples and displaying the data on LED displays.
