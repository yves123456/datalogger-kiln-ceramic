This Arduino program is designed to collect temperature data from a pottery kiln using a MAX31856 thermocouple. The temperature readings are displayed on a TM1637 LED display and output via the serial monitor. The program includes error checking for the thermocouple and indicates errors using LED signals.
Components and Connections

    MAX31856 Thermocouple:
        CS (Chip Select) -> Pin 13 (Brown)
        SCK (Serial Clock) -> Pin 12 (Purple)
        DO (Data Out) -> Pin 11 (Blue)
        DI (Data In) -> Pin 10 (Green)

    cpp

Adafruit_MAX31856 maxthermo = Adafruit_MAX31856(13, 10, 11, 12);

TM1637 LED Display:

    CLK -> Pin 6 (White)
    DIO -> Pin 7 (Gray)

cpp

    TM1637Display display1 = TM1637Display(6, 7);

Libraries Used

    Adafruit_MAX31856 for interfacing with the MAX31856 thermocouple.
    TM1637Display for controlling the TM1637 LED display.

Variables

    templu, templuamb: Real-time temperature readings from the thermocouple.
    templuavant: Previous temperature reading.
    delta: Temperature change between readings.
    pente: Rate of temperature change.
    deltatps: Time delta for logging.
    tchs1: Thermocouple status.
    tcerr: Error flag for thermocouple.
    sderr: Error flag for SD card (not used in this version).

Setup Function

    Initializes serial communication at 9600 baud.
    Sets up the MAX31856 thermocouple with appropriate settings:
        Thermocouple type S.
        Continuous conversion mode.
        50Hz noise filter.
    Configures LED pins for error indication.
    Initializes variables for temperature logging.

Main Loop

    Checks for faults in the thermocouple and sets error flags if any are found.
    Reads temperature from the thermocouple if the conversion is complete.
    Logs the temperature and related data every 50 cycles (approximately every 100 seconds).
    Displays the current temperature on the TM1637 LED display.
    Uses LED indicators to signal errors.

Error Handling

    If any faults are detected in the thermocouple, the error flag tchs1 is set.
    LED connected to Pin 44 is turned on if an error is detected.

Example Output

    Temperature readings and related data are printed to the serial monitor.

This program provides a straightforward method for monitoring and displaying the temperature of a pottery kiln using a thermocouple and an LED display. The error checking mechanism ensures reliable data collection by indicating any issues with the thermocouple.
