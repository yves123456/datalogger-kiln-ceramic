This Arduino program is designed to collect temperature data from a pottery kiln using a thermocouple. The collected data is logged onto an SD card and displayed on an LCD and LED screen. The components involved include a MAX31856 thermocouple, a DS3231 real-time clock, an SD card module, an I2C LCD display, and a TM1637 LED display.

Libraries Used

    TM1637Display for the LED display.
    Adafruit_MAX31856 for the thermocouple.
    SPI and SD for SD card operations.
    DS3231 for the RTC.
    Wire and LiquidCrystal_I2C for the LCD display.

Variables

    templu, templua, templuavant: Real-time and previous temperatures.
    deltatps, delta, pente: Time delta and temperature changes.
    tchs1: Thermocouple status.
    sderr: SD card error flag.

Setup

    Initializes the serial communication, RTC, LCD, and thermocouple.
    Configures the LCD to display a startup message.
    Sets the thermocouple type and conversion mode.
    Initializes the SD card and sets up the initial logging parameters.

Main Loop

    Checks for faults in the thermocouple and logs any errors.
    Reads the temperature from the thermocouple and displays it on the LCD.
    Logs the data to the SD card every specified interval (deltatps).
    Displays the current temperature on the LED display.

Functions

    Write_PlxDaq(): Writes data to an Excel file via serial communication.
    Initialize_PlxDaq(): Initializes the Excel file for logging.
    Initialize_SDcard(): Sets up the SD card for data logging.
    Write_SDcard(): Writes temperature and timestamp data to the SD card.

This program provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and logging the temperature of a pottery kiln, ensuring data is recorded for future analysis.
